# ETL Pipeline Automation for WorldBank GDP Data with Python

This project aims to streamline the Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) process by developing a Python script. The script efficiently extracts data from a CSV file, performs necessary transformations, and uploads the refined data to a designated SQL table in a PostgreSQL database. The primary objective is to convert the original data into a more coherent and analytically friendly format, facilitating ease of data analysis.

## Key Features

- **Extraction:** Read data from a CSV file.

- **Transformation:** Apply necessary data transformations for enhanced readability and analysis.

- **Loading:** Upload the transformed data into a PostgreSQL database.

## Why This Project?

Managing data effectively is a critical aspect of any data-driven project. This ETL pipeline automation simplifies the process, making it more accessible and efficient for users to prepare data for analysis.

## Tools Used

- Python
- PostgreSQL
